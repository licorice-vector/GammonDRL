# GammonDRL
A backgammon AI built using deep reinforcement learning.

## Reinforcement Learning
The AI learns by playing itself. The learning algorithm used is temporal difference learning and the methodology is very similar to the famous TD-Gammon AI developed by Gerald Tesauro in 1992.

## Deep Learning
The deep learning part of this project uses my own DL library [RevGrad](https://github.com/licorice-vector/RevGrad.git).
